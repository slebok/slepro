This code base is (going to be) used for teaching on the subject of Software Language Engineering. The code base covers some elements of parsing, unparsing, editing, transformation, analysis, semantics, metamodeling, model transformations, and yet others. A more profound description is on its way. 

This code base feeds into a collaborative effort by Anya Helene Bagge and Ralf Lämmel on teaching material and possibly a text book on software language engineering. All rights reserved for the code, as it stands. A liberal license will be applied soon. Disclaimer: this material is under construction.

PS: I am making this code openly available, as I will be using some of it in my SPLASH 2013 tutorial. Discalimer: again, this material is pretty much under construction.
