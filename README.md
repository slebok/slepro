This code base captures some part of the body of knowledge on Software Language Engineering. This effort covers some elements of parsing, unparsing, editing, transformation, analysis, semantics, metamodeling, model transformations, and yet others. A more profound description is on its way. All rights reserved for the code, as it stands. A liberal license will be applied soon. Disclaimer: this material is under construction.

PS: I am making this code openly available, as I am using bits in tutorials. (I have given related tutorials at SPLASH 2013 and MODELS 2014.) Discalimer: again, this material is not polished and probably needs a lot more work to be operationally useful for others.
