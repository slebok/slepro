- An FSM language
  - Concrete syntax for FSMs
  - Code generator for Java
  - Export to GraphViz
  - Simulation as semantics
  - Determinism/Termination as static semantics
- Grow a language like Anya
  * SimplTrivial.rsc
  * SimplVars.rsc
  * SimplFuns.rsc
  * SimplExpr.rsc?
- Demonstrate megamodeling; see attic/ontologies
- Add operators for figures
- What other cool but simple DSL?
- Something based on a solver
- Add prelude/rewriting.pro
- Use strategies in expr language
- Use strategies in yafpl language
- Consider a variation on expr with integers
- QVT/TGG/ATL
- Some (what?) ontology use
- Concrete object syntax
- Partial evaluation for yafpl
- Semantics for expr
- Semantics for figure (GraphViz)
- Name binding etc.
- Attributed trees
